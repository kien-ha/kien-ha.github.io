Some apps are running in the background and will persistently notify you that
it is running in the background. That is, that it is impossible to swipe away.
This is a guide to help hide these persistent apps.

1. Open 'settings'
2. Under 'Device' section, open 'Notifications'
3. Find 'Android system' and open it (may need to enable 'show system apps'
in the more options found in 'Notifications')
4. Find and toggle 'Apps running in background' off
