            <h2>Thoughts on Internship with OpenDayLight</h2>
            <p>

            <p>
                Hello,
            </p>
            <p>
                Today is the final day of my internship and so I have decided to leave
                my thoughts of working on Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) and with the
                community.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I first started working on JJB, I had very basic programming
                knowledge and with limited to none knowledge on Git, GitHub, and Gerrit.
                My goal for the internship was to expand my knowledge and gain some work
                experience in an open source environment. Over the last 3 months of
                working on the JJB project, I have acquired essential skills such as
                using Git and Gerrit, ways to problem solve, and improve my programming
                skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also gained valuable experience on how the open source community
                work together. Because of the nature of having to review patches on
                Gerrit before merging any patches into the main branch, I was able to
                improve and write better code from reviews given by experts and more
                experienced programmers. Their perspectives and thoughts when problems
                arises were valuable as more often than not, I would have not thought of
                or considered. I like JJBâ€™s documentation since it is often consistent,
                and concise. This allows me to rely on the documentation while I am
                working.The open source community has been friendly and helpful whenever
                I needed help. They are always willing to help wherever they can.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think however, that patches are slow to be reviewed on. There are many
                patches that are weeks old. Few patches are months, and even a year old.
            </p>
                Working on JJB, I have attained more than my goals and expectations as I
                have become a core reviewer of JJB. I plan on continuing to contribute
                wherever I can after this internship is over.
            <p>
                Thank you JJB team, OpenStack, OpenDayLight, and the rest of the
                community for the internship. It has been a great experience.
            </p>

                complete table of plugins that I have worked on and weekly work log
                found at the bottom of the document [1].
